# Percent Of Your Life


## What is?

This project is a simple app that, just by using your age, calculates an approximate time of your life, making percentages and counters.

To obtain these numbers, the app uses an average global life expectancy of approximately 80 years, so the results are very likely to be imprecise.


## How does it work?

When entering this [link](https://ismacortgtz.github.io/PercentOfYourLife/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} you will see a text field where you will have to enter your age, after that click on `Next` and you will see all the information calculated using your age , you can use the `Return` button to enter another age.

## Additional info

This app is made in vanilla JS, also using vanilla CSS, without libraries or Frameworks.
